## ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Detection

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and building a simple predictive system. While this is primarily a learning project, it highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in healthcare research.

### Dataset

Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (available via sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()).

Features: 30 numerical features describing cell nuclei (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness).

Target:

0 â†’ Malignant

1 â†’ Benign

Samples: 569

### Workflow

Data Collection and Processing

Loaded dataset from scikit-learn

Converted into a Pandas DataFrame

Explored statistical measures and class distribution

Feature & Target Separation

Features (X) contain cell characteristics

Target (Y) represents tumor class

Train-Test Split

Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%)

Model Training

Logistic Regression model trained on the training set

Model Evaluation

Accuracy measured on training and testing sets

Model achieved high accuracy on both

Predictive System

Allows user to input feature values

Predicts whether the tumor is benign or malignant

### Technologies Used

Python 

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

### How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Shambhavi910/Breast_Cancer_Detection.git
cd Breast_Cancer_Detection


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Breast_cancer_detection.ipynb

### Results

Logistic Regression achieved high accuracy on both training and test datasets.

Predictive system successfully classifies new data inputs as malignant or benign.

### Future Enhancements

Experiment with additional models (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).

Perform hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.

Deploy the predictive system using Flask or Streamlit.
